# Voxora_Prototype
AI-powered content generator prototype for Kuku FM project
                                                                  VOXORA - Tired of searching? Just let AI start speaking
AI-Driven Proposal for KUKU FM
Project Title - Voxora -Your Gateway to Infinite Audio by AI
Objective: 
To enhance daily engagement and session frequency on Kuku FM by introducing Voxora – an AI-powered feature that allows users to generate personalized audio content on any topic, in real time, using preferred languages and voice styles. By offering unlimited, on-demand storytelling and learning experiences, Voxora transforms passive listening into an active, personalized journey.
Gap Identified:
Kuku FM currently offers only pre-recorded content from its internal library. If a user asks for a topic outside this library, it is not available instantly. This limits user engagement, personalization, and the platform's ability to fulfill on-demand needs.
I’m not just someone pitching an idea. I’m someone who lives the problem.
My Story: Why I am Proposing this
I’ve always been a curious learner. Sometimes it’s wanting to understand how the stock market works, or hearing the story of a cricketer like Rohit Sharma. But each time, I had to scroll through Google, open long YouTube videos, and spend time filtering what was useful.
Then I realized:
People don’t want to search, they want answers.
People don’t want to read long texts, they want experiences.
And people want it in their own language, in their own style.  
Solution: By the idea of Voxora — an AI tool I built where users:
- Enter any topic (e.g., "What is black hole?" or "Tell me a story about a forest king")
- The system fetches top 5 results from trusted sources (Google, YouTube, Wikipedia)
- Summarizes the data using LLMs
- Converts summary to English audio
- Generates small illustrative images per summary section to attract 
- Produces a short video with audio + visuals
- Offers multilingual translation with native voices
 
Consumer Value: Voxora adds value like
- Learning + Entertainment in one platform
- On-demand personalization: no more waiting for a specific podcast
- Regional + emotional voiceovers for relatability
- Ideal for: students, professionals, parents, and infotainment lovers
Generative AI Tools, Techniques, and Data Sources
Stage	                           Tools & Models Used
Text Collection	         -   Search APIs (Google/Wiki/YouTube), Web Scrapers
Summarization	         - LLMs like GPT-4 / LLaMA / Mistral via LangChain for clean 
Text-to-Speech (TTS) -TTS.api models like Tacotron2-DDC, ElevenLabs, Google TTS
Translation	        - M2M-100, IndicTrans, or multilingual TTS tools
Image Generation     - Stable Diffusion (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) for visual scenes
Video Composition   - MoviePy and ffmpeg for syncing audio with visuals
Interface	        - Gradio frontend for topic input, summary, and audio preview
AI Integration in Voxora – Creation -> Operation -> Analysis
Creation Phase (Real-Time Content Generation)
Steps Involved:
1. User Input Prompt (e.g., “What is quantum entanglement?”)
2. Information Retrieval -Web scraping from top 5 Google/Wikipedia/YouTube sources 
3. Summarization via LLMs - GPT-4 / Mistral / LLaMA generates a concise, user-friendly summary
4. Text-to-Speech (TTS) - TTS model like Tacotron2-DDC or ElevenLabs narrates the content in English
5. Multilingual Translation + Audio -  Summary is translated using M2M-100 or IndicTrans
     TTS models convert translated text into native audio output (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
6. Image Generation and Video Composition - Topic-relevant prompts are passed into Stable          Diffusion to create visuals, and MoviePy merges TTS audio and images into a clean, short video
Ongoing Operation (Daily Use & Scaling)
Once the system is deployed, AI powers its continuous operations behind the scenes, ensuring freshness, responsiveness, and personalization.
Key Functions:
Prompt handling system: Receives and interprets text input from users
Auto-Generation Triggers: Frequently asked topics are preprocessed daily and new content can be scheduled hourly/daily using cron jobs or event queues
Language Personalization Engine: Detects user language preference and emotional tone and Adjusts voice speed, pitch, and accent for better relatability
Caching Popular Content: Most-queried summaries and videos are stored and reused and reduces GPU inference costs and speeds up delivery
User Interaction Logging: Tracks what was played, skipped, or re-listened and Stores user-specific engagement metrics.
Continuous Analysis (Learning & Optimization):
The AI system will not be static — it will learn and evolve based on usage data, feedback, and trends.
Analysis Features:
Content Feedback Loop: Collect user thumbs-up/down, replay rate, or optional “Did this help?” inputs and Use this feedback to retrain LLM prompt templates and improve output quality
Trending Topic Detector: Tracks real-time search trends using APIs and Auto-suggests trending topics for proactive generation
Prompt Refinement AI: Clusters user queries to find gaps or missed subjects and Automatically improves phrasing and structure for future prompts
Language Accuracy Tracker: Tracks mismatch between original and translated output and Uses BLEU score or semantic similarity metrics to improve localization
Performance Tuning Metrics: Latency of generation, GPU memory usage, load balancing efficiency, and helping to scale infrastructure cost-effectively as demand grows.
Implementation Plan + User Engagement
Implementation Timeline (6 Weeks Plan)
Phase     	Timeline	         Deliverables
Phase 1 	Week 1–2	Gradio UI → Topic Input → English Summary & Audio 
Phase 2	              Week 3–4   	Image Generation + Audio Merging → Short Visual Video  
Phase 3 	Week 5–6	Native Language Audio + Emotion Tone → personalized content 
Step 1 – Topic to Summary + English Audio
 
This shows my working system that takes a user input, summarizes the topic, and narrates it in English audio.
Step 2 – Audio + Image = Video
 
Here’s a generated scenic video made by merging Stable Diffusion visuals and TTS audio — one-click content delivery.
Step 3 – Native Language Audio 
 
Voxora starts by asking users to choose their native or preferred language via a simple dropdown menu.  
Key Challenges & Proposed Solutions	
Challenge	Proposed Solutions
High cost of LLMs, TTS, and image generation	Use open-source models (e.g., Mistral, Tacotron2), and cache popular topics locally

Delay in generating content (especially video)	Asynchronous processing + preload common/trending prompts

Inaccurate or robotic-sounding native language audio	Fine-tune TTS models on Indic languages and use emotional voice models (e.g., Coqui)

Misuse or unsafe user prompts (offensive topics, fake news, etc.)		Add prompt filtering, moderation layers, and a blacklist of restricted topics

Storage and scalability of audio + video for thousands of users daily	Implement content expiration policy and cloud storage (S3, GCS) with lazy loading
Metrics & KPIs to Measure Success
Metrics	What it Measures
App Opens Per User Per Day	Increase in app re-engagement through personalized content

Average Session Duration	Time users spend listening/watching Voxora content
Prompt Usage Rate	How many users are interacting with Voxora daily
Repeat Plays / Re-listens	Indicates habit formation and content quality

Content Share Rate	Organic growth via shared short audio clips

Language Personalization Engagement	Number of users choosing native language playback
AI Content Feedback Score	Real-time feedback on usefulness, clarity, and enjoyment
This isn't just a prototype. It's a real vision backed by working systems. All it needs is a home inside Kuku FM.
 Voxora will transform Kuku FM into:
- A daily-use assistant
- A personalized infotainment engine
- A multilingual AI-powered storyteller
